MOTIV-JOURNAL

This was my capstone project at Launch Academy.  I designed a motivational journal where a randomized prompt is generated from a Rails backend to a form which was done in React.  Then the user could type in a response to the prompt and then the new entry was posted to the database.  On the index page, a user can see all the entries he/she created.  

STEPS TO RUN THE APP

1. Git clone the project on to your machine.

2. Open up the termianl and run the command `npm start` and start the rails server on a different tab with the command `rails s`.  

3. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app displayed.

4. Create a username and password.

5. Begin writing entries!

6. All tests should be passing at this point!
